# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive visualizer for sorting and pathfinding algorithms, available as both a web application and a Java application. It's designed to help users gain insights into the inner workings of different algorithms through interactive visual simulations.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize classic sorting algorithms with animations.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Understand how pathfinding works by watching real-time maze-solving.

## Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the web application.
- Backend: Java for the standalone application.
